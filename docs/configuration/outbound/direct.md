`direct` outbound send requests directly.

### Structure

    {
      "type": "direct",
      "tag": "direct-out",
      
      "override_address": "1.0.0.1",
      "override_port": 53,

### Direct Fields

#### override_address

Override the connection destination address.

#### override_port

Override the connection destination port.

### Dial Fields

#### detour

The tag of the upstream outbound.

Other dial fields will be ignored when enabled.

#### bind_interface

The network interface to bind to.

#### bind_address

The address to bind to.

#### routing_mark

!!! error ""

    Linux only

The iptables routing mark.

#### reuse_addr

Reuse listener address.

#### connect_timeout

Connect timeout, in golang's Duration format.

A duration string is a possibly signed sequence of
decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix,
such as "300ms", "-1.5h" or "2h45m".
Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".

#### domain_strategy

One of `prefer_ipv4` `prefer_ipv6` `ipv4_only` `ipv6_only`.

If set, the requested domain name will be resolved to IP before routing.

`dns.strategy` will be used if empty.

#### fallback_delay

The length of time to wait before spawning a RFC 6555 Fast Fallback connection.
That is, is the amount of time to wait for IPv6 to succeed before assuming
that IPv6 is misconfigured and falling back to IPv4 if `prefer_ipv4` is set.
If zero, a default delay of 300ms is used.

Only take effect when `domain_strategy` is `prefer_ipv4` or `prefer_ipv6`.
